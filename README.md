dotfiles
========

Welcome to configuration-land.

I like to have my dotfiles accessible universally.
I typically make the appropriate sym link like so:
$ ln -s thisdirectory/somedotfile ~/.somedotfile

NOTE: I’ve created directory “compatible” which aims
at being a light configuration only and should be compatible
accross linux and osx
