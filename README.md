# Dotfiles

I made this repo so that I wouldn't be so damn confused when I make bash
scripts and aliases on different servers and machines.  If I make a cool
function in one \*NIXy place, then I want it to be available all over.

This one has some crossover with the Ansible repo also, as I found it to be
unsatisfactory to maintain different dotfile branches for Darwin OS and for
Debian OS, etc.  There is some automation in there that I'm still hashing out.
